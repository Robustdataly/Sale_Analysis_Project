# Sale_Analysis_Project

Sales Company Project
INTRODUCTION
This is an analysis of a dataset of a Sales company, the full dataset was gotten from Six CSV files namely:  Sales_Power_Pivot, Employee_Lookup, Customer_Lookup, Product_Lookup, Store_Lookup, and Calendar. These files were modeled and connected using the PowerPivot. This was a project given to us in a bootcamp I attended 
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
In other to help the Company assess its performance, suggest better ways to improve and maximize its potentials. The following will be determined:
1.	KPI: Sum of Revenue realized, Sum of quantity sold, Total number of Customer, Best Revenue Product, Most sold Product
2.	Revenue by Transaction time Hour
3.	Revenue and Order by Store
4.	Revenue by Customer age
5.	Revenue by Employee Position
6.	Best Five Staff by Revenue
7.	Best Five Customer by Revenue
*DATA SOURCE*
This Dataset was gotten from the Data Analytics Boot Camp, but originally sourced from Kaggle.
DATA TRANSFORMATION
Just as usual the ETL process was carried out, after the Six files have been downloaded, the files were imported one after the other into Power Query after which necessary cleaning and adjustment was carried out. The files were loaded into Power Pivot where the Star Schema model was built for it, with one to many relationship. The sale file has the many relationships while other files have one. Reports were generated from the model.
